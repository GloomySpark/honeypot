# Introduction

### You contribution is welcome

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to Honeypot. The best way to make Honeypot fit everyone needs is having the largest community. 

### Why reading the guidelines is important ?

>Following these guidelines helps you know what the project goal is and how you could help achieving it. By respecting the guidelines, you prove that you respect given work and, in return, developers should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Which kind of contribution is expected ?

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

> Honeypot is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Honeypot itself. You can also simply integrate Honeypot to you website and make it known. 

### What are the contributions we do not want ?

Honeypot is done during our spare time. For this reason, please read carefully the contribution guidelines and the forum so we do not have to answer same questions twice. 

For same reason, issues and support questions that are not well documented will simply be closed and ignored. 

We expect from our community to be polite and gentle. We reserve the right to ban anyone who would not be respectful. 

# Ground Rules
### What we expect from YOU and what you should expect from US ?
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). 

> Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://github.com/dominiquevienne/honeypot/blob/master/pull-request-review-checklist.md
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. 
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [PHP Code of Conduct](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/adopt-code-of-conduct).

# Your First Contribution
You are new to the Honeypot project and want help? You are welcome. If you do not feel comfortable, just ask a maintainer, we are here to help. 

Many minor contributions would help you start and make the first step, from translate documentation to make some great tutorials or pull requests. 

# Getting started
### What to do to contribute (major changes) ?
>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.

### What to do to contribute (minor changes) ?

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without creating any fork.

>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Security first
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email maintainer instead.

The email should contain the answers of these two questions:y issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

### How to report a bug ?

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Honeypot are you using ?
2. Which environment are you on (LAMP, MAMP, WAMP, versions, ... ) ?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Always use Github project issues manager to submit an issue that is not a security issue.
